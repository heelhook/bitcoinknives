# ðŸ”ª Bitcoin Knives

Bitcoin Knives is a Ruby on rails app that monitors the price of Bitcoin
and automatically purchases when price moves down X% over Y% period. The amount
it purchases is also configurable, so that it allows to run the following:

* When bitcoin's price goes down 5% over 24 hours buy $percentage-changed x 100,000 sats.
  * If it falls 5% = 500,000
  * If it falls 10% = 10,000,000

Bitcoin Knives uses the user exchange and never has access to funds.

## Supported Exchanges

* Kraken

##### Run the daemons

Once you have your rules setup you can kill the `rails server` and start
